#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - the while loop runs up until values of a reach n * n * n (n^3), but inside, a grows by n * n (n^2) each time.

b) O(n logn) - for loop that has a time complexity of O(n) with a nested while loop that runs O(logn) times.

c) O(n) - where n is equal to value of bunnies. This function executes its if statement in O(1) with n recursive calls.
